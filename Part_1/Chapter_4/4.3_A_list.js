/*
Write a fiunction arrayToList that builds up a list structure
like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument.
```
  let list = {
    value: 1.
    rest : {
      value: 2,
      rest : {
        value : 3,
        rest: null
      }
    }
  };
```
  Also write a listArray function that produces an array from a list.
  Then add a helper function prepend, which takes an element and a list
and creates a new list that add the element to the front on the input list.
and nth that takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position
in the list or undefined when there is no such element.
If you haven't already , also write a recursive version  of nth.
